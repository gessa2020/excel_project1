# Human Resource Attrition Analytics
## An Excel project on Leveraging Data to Reduce Attrition Risk and Retain Top Talent
![](Screenshots/Coverpage2.jpg)
## Introduction
This project entails conducting an in-depth analysis of employee attrition at an imaginary Company X using HR analytics techniques. Human resource analytics has emerged as a crucial function enabling data-driven workforce optimization. It applies analytical techniques to employee data across the talent lifecycle - from recruitment and onboarding to performance management, engagement, retention, and offboarding.
By gathering, integrating, and analyzing HR metrics, organizations can gain a quantified view of workforce productivity, capacity, costs, risks, and opportunities. 
Essentially, HR analytics introduces an evidence-based approach toward strategic human capital management. It allows HR leaders to accurately measure the ROI of various programs, forecast talent needs, identify drivers of employee behavior, optimize processes, and recommend data-backed interventions that enhance workforce capability, agility, and experience.
With fierce competition for skilled talent, it has become imperative for HR to adopt analytics in managing people - the most important asset in a company.
The goal is to provide data-backed recommendations on compensation structuring, career development, managerial coaching, and other areas to minimize regrettable attrition of high-potential employees. Implementing a strategic retention program based on analytical findings can help Company X protect its talent capital and knowledge assets.
### Data source
The data used for this project is dummy data that does not represent any specific company but is used to demonstrate the capabilities of Excel in creating visually appealing, dynamic, and intuitive user-friendly dashboards.
Below are some of the questions that can be answered by the dashboard that will be created in this project.

##  Problem statement 
1. __How many active employees does the company have?__
2. __What is the percentage attrition rate by the employees?__
3. __Which gender has the highest attrition rate in this organization?__
4. __What department has the lowest or highest attrition by gender?__
5. __Which age group has the highest employee attrition in this company?__
6. __Which marital status has the lowest attrition?__
7. __Which education field has the highest attrition by gender?__
 
 
## Skills demonstrated.
- I used PowerPoint to create the background for this project
- I used then entirely used Excel as a tool to create the dashboard.

We then use the <a href="https://developer.adzuna.com/">Adzuna API</a> to scrape data of number of technology jobs in some selected US cities and store them in an excel file 

We also use the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 data to create a dashboard with IBM Cognos visualization tool to visualize and present our analysis<br>
Note:This randomised subset contains around 1/10th of the original data set.<br> Our Conclusions drawn after analyzing this subset may not reflect the real world scenario<br>

## Data transformation and cleaning.
1.  The survey dataset goes through various cleaning processes before being visualized in the IBM Cognos tool.
2.  Data from both the Api and scraped web page also undergoes cleaning and reformating before being visualized.

## Data analysis and visualization
Graph showing number of jobs generated by each technology![](IMAGES/tech_jobs.png)
### key take ways from the graph above
- Java technology had the most number of job opportunities among all the languages
- The next three languages that followed according to job opportunities created were GO, SQL and Python

Graph showing salaries for different technologies![](IMAGES/salary_langauge.png)
### Key observations from the graph above
- The swift language had the highest annual salary followed by Python, C++, Javascript, Java and then Go
- Apart from Java creating the most job opportunities, it does not top the table of the highest annual salaries but it takes the 5th position

### key take aways from the graphs above
- MySQL most popular
- Microsoft SQL comes next in popularity after Mysql
- MongoDB and Redis are upcoming favorites
- New kid on the block: Elasticsearch
- Open source databases are still preferable in companies
- NoSQL databases are must have databasese for storing non relational data
- Redis supports abstract data types
- Postgre databases is most likely to become very popular than MySQL in coming years

## Conclussion
- With AI and ML in rising demand, Python is the language to look out for because of itâ€™s vast libraries and ecosystem.
- Open source databases are here to stay with us for all forms of tabular data
- NoSQL databases are the standard for unstructured data
- Big Data technology in companies still requires SQL
